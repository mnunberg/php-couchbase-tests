SDK-testing provided tests for php-ext-couchbase:

Usage:
Build the php extension as normal.
The runtests.pl script (which in the future, will actually run the tests :))
will replace the upstream tests directory with the ones found here.

You Something like:

./runtests.pl -s ~/src/php-ext-couchbase/ -h 10.3.121.209

Where -s is the source directory, and -h is the cluster entry point.

Then you can chdir back to the php-ext-couchbase directory and run make-test
as normal.
